# Getting Started with Barco on Kubernetes

TODO: NEEDS ADAPTING

Barco supports producing and consuming events using HTTP APIs.

## Producing

Sending events to Barco is as simple as sending a HTTP request. Use your favorite HTTP client in your technology stack
to produce events.

### Producing an event using curl

```shell
TOPIC="my-topic"
curl -X POST -i -d '{"hello":"world"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "http://barco.streams:9251/v1/topic/${TOPIC}/messages"
```

Note that `9251` is the default producing port. The Barco service will route to a broker in a round-robin way when no
partition key is specified.

If you want to specify the partition key, you can set it in the querystring.

```shell
PARTITION_KEY="key1"
TOPIC="my-topic"
curl -X POST -i -d '{"hello":"world"}' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    "http://barco.streams:9251/v1/topic/${TOPIC}/messages?partitionKey=${PARTITION_KEY}"
```

### Producing an event in Go

You can use the [official Go Client][go-client]. There's no need to target a port in the service url, the client
will discover the cluster and send the request to the broker that is the partition leader for a key.

```go
import (
	"strings"

	"github.com/barcostreams/go-client"
)

// ...

producer, err := barco.NewProducer("barco://barco.streams")
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

topic := "my-topic"
message := strings.NewReader(`{"hello": "world"}`)
partitionKey := "" // Empty to use a random partition

if err := producer.Send(topic, message, partitionKey); err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
```

## Consuming

For reading events from Barco, you should generally need a client library as the consumer needs to subscribe to topics,
poll for messages and commit the offsets.

### Consuming events in Go

Using the [Go Client][go-client], you can just poll in loop and the client will take care of the rest.

```go
import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/barcostreams/go-client"
)


// ...

group := "group1"
consumer, err := barco.NewConsumer("barco://barco.streams", group, topic)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}

for {
	pollResult := consumer.Poll()
	if pollResult.Error != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Found error while polling: %s", pollResult.Error)
		continue
	}

	// New records organized by topic
	for _, topicRecords := range pollResult.TopicRecords {
		for _, record := range topicRecords.Records {
			fmt.Println(string(record.Body), record.Timestamp)
		}
	}
}
```
