# Run Barco with Docker Compose

For local application development and CI environments, you can use [docker compose][docker-compose] to run Barco.

You can run a single-broker cluster in developer mode using the following service definition:

```
version: "3.9"
services:
  barco:
    image: "barcostreams/barco:latest"
    environment:
      - BARCO_DEV_MODE=true
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:9250/status"]
      interval: 1s
      retries: 60
      start_period: 2s
      timeout: 1s
```
